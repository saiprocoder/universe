            <p class="sectionTag text-small">We live in Earth, the Earth lies Solar System, but the Solar System lies in the Milky Way galaxy, but the Milky Way galaxy lies in the Universe. So indirectly we live in the Universe. It is a place where we all live. If there is no universe, there is no us!! Let's think about how the universe was formed.</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-small">There are many theories which tell how our universe was formed. But, the most popular theory is the Big Bang Theory. Before we move on to the theory. Let's know about some discoveries.</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Discoveries</p>
            <br><br>
            <p class="sectionTag text-small">As long as 340 BC the Greek philosopher Aristotle, in his book On The Heavens, was able to put forward two arguments for believing that the Earth was a round sphere rather than a flat plate. First, he realized that eclipses of the moon were caused by the Earth coming between the Sun and the Earth coming between the Sun and the Moon. The Earth's shadow on the Moon was always round, which would be true only if the Earth was spherical. If the Earth had been a flat disc, the shadow would have been elongated and elliptical, unless the eclipse occured at the time when the Sun was directly under the centre of the disc. Second, the Greeks know from their travels that the North Star appeared lower in the sky when viewed in South than it did in more northerly regions. (Since the North Star lies over the North Pole it appears to be directly above an observer at the North Pole, but to someone looking from the Equator, it appears to be just at the horizon.) Aristotle thought the Earth was at rest and the that the Sun, the Moon, the planets, and the stars moved in circular orbits around the Earth. But then a Polish priest, Nicholas Copernicus said that the Earth moved around the Sun. He created a simple model for his statement. Nearly a century passed before the idea was taken seriously. The two astronomers --- the German, Johannes Kepler, and the Italian, Galileo and Galilei --- started publicly to support the Copernican theory, despite the fact that the orbits it predicted did not quite match the ones observed. In 1687, when Sir Issac Newton published Philosophaie Naturalis Principia Mathematica, probably the most important single work ever published in the physical sciences, Newton postualted a law of universal gravitation according to which each body in the universe was attracted toward every other body by a force that was stronger the more massive the bodies and the closer they were to each other. It was the same force that caused objects to fall to the ground. Newton went on to show that, according to his law, gravity causes the Moon to move in an elliptical orbit around the Earth and causes the and the other planets to follow elliptical paths around the Sun.</p>

            <br><br>
            <p class="sectionTag text-small">Newton realized that, according to his theory of gravity the stars should attract each other, so it seemed they could not remain motionless. Would they not all fall at the same point? In a letter in 1961 to Richard Bentley, another leading thinker of this day, Newton argued that this would indeed if there were only a finite number of stars distributed over a finite region of space. But he reasoned that if, on the other hand, there were an infinite number of stars, distributed more or less uniformly over infinite space, this would not happen, because there would not be any central point for them to fall to. In 1929, Edwin Hubble made the landmark observation that wherever you look, distant galaxies are moving rapidly away from us. In other words, the universe in expanding. This means that at earlier times objects would have been closer together. In fact, it seemed that there was a time, about 10 or 20 thousand million years ago, when they were all exactly at the same place and when, therefore, the density was infinite. This discovery brought the question of beginning of universe into the realm of science. And this point might have exploded and then the whole universe might have been formed. This is the Big Bang Theory.</p>
