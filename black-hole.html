            <p class="sectionTag text-small">Black holes are of very recent origin. They are named black holes because that's what they are black voids in space. Black holes form when a supergiant star dies and blasts that is called supernova. After supernova the energy compresses and has a point with infinite density. However, great scientists do not think that a star can go to zero size. Then the gravitational force becomes really powerfull. So even light, cannot go through a black hole. Light's speed is 10<sup>8</sup> m/s. According to the Einstein's theory of general relativity there is nothing faster than light. So, there is nothing that can go past the black hole. There is a particular place after which nothing can get out of a black hole. The track is called Event Horizon. If a person goes inside the event horizon he/she can never come back. They will be stretched like noodles. There are theories that there are wormholes at the end of black holes. People think there are white holes at the end of black holes. Scroll down to know about white holes.</p>

            <br><br>
            <p class="sectionTag text-small">We don't think white holes exist. Becuase if there are white holes, they should be visible to us at the night sky becuase think about the name, White! White holes form when stars die. But stars die every second. Black holes cannot be seen because they are black voids in space.</p>
